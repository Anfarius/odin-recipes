        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Our simple savoury pancake recipe is great with a 
            sprinkling of strong cheddar and chunks of ham for an 
            easy supper or weekend brunch.
        </p>
        <p>
            Try other toppings such as spring onions, tomatoes, 
            mushrooms, spinach, roasted vegetables or feta 
            cheese.

        <h2>Ingridients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>200g plain flour</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>500ml milk</li>
            <li>oil, for frying</li>
            <li>130g ham, cut into small chunks</li>
            <li>150g cheddar cheese, grated</li>
        </ul>    
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Using electric beaters or a hand whisk, combine 
                the flour, eggs and milk with a big pinch of salt 
                in a large bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat a 20cm crÃªpe pan until very hot, then pour a 
                little oil into the pan. Swirl the pan so the oil 
                creates an even covering. Ladle a spoonful of the 
                pancake mixture into the pan and tip the pan so 
                the mixture fills the pan in an even layer. Cook 
                for 30 seconds, then flip and scatter with some 
                cheese and ham, and cook until the cheese is 
                melting. Add a crack of black pepper and fold. 
                Keep on a plate covered with foil in a warm oven 
                while you make the remaining pancakes.
